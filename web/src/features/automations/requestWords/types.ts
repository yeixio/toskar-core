// The words an automation request is read with, one file per language.
//
// Phrases are lowercase and matched against the request after it is
// lowercased and NFKC-normalized (full-width digits become 0-9, ’ becomes ').
// A phrase is plain text with a few marks:
//
//   (a|b)   either word          (only )?  an optional part
//   …       up to 40 characters   #         an amount, such as $500 or 5万円
//
// In a language written with spaces between words, a space in a phrase
// matches any run of spaces, and a phrase matches only whole words. In a
// language written without them (Japanese, Chinese, Korean with its attached
// particles), spaces are optional and phrases match anywhere.
//
// To add a language, copy en.ts, translate the words, and list the file in
// index.ts. Tests in parseRequest.test.ts read the language's example
// request (form.describePlaceholder in automations.json).
