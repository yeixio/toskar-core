# Configuration

Yggdrasil Core is configured in three places:

- **`config.json`** in the data directory: where the daemon listens, where it keeps files, and how it finds other computers. It is read at startup.
- **Environment variables** (`YGGDRASIL_*`) override some `config.json` values. They are meant for containers and scripted nodes.
- **Settings** are stored in the database and changed in the app or through `PATCH /api/v1/settings`. Most take effect at once.

## Data directory

| OS | Default |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Yggdrasil` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Yggdrasil` |
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/yggdrasil`, or `~/.local/share/yggdrasil` |

Start the daemon with `-data-dir <path>` to use another directory, such as a second daemon for testing. A `config.json` that does not set `data_dir` belongs to the directory it is in. `yggctl paths` prints the default paths.

What lives there:

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `config.json` | The values below. Written with mode `0600`. |
| `yggdrasil.db` | SQLite: models, profiles, chats, memories, settings, automations, specialized AIs and their examples, knowledge indexes and vectors, run records, notifications, API key hashes, paired computers. |
| `models/` | Installed GGUF model files. |
| `runtimes/llamacpp/` | `llama-server` and the other llama.cpp programs. |
| `runtimes/python/` | `uv`, a private Python, and the environments for training (`envs/trainer-mlx`, `envs/trainer-peft`), text recognition (`envs/ocr`), and running code (`envs/code`), each installed the first time it is needed. |
| `artifacts/` | Files attached to chats and files the assistant made, one folder per chat. |
| `knowledge/` | Copies of pasted and uploaded knowledge, and `ocr-cache/` (recognized text of scanned PDFs). |
| `training/` | Trained adapters (`adapters/`), exported GGUF files (`exports/`), job working files (`jobs/`, removed when a job ends), and downloaded training weights (`hf-cache/`). |
| `code-runs/` | Each code run's working folder, deleted when the run ends. |
| `logs/` | `daemon.log` (JSON) and llama-server logs. |
| `secrets/` | This computer's identity (`node-<id>.key`, `.pub`), and credentials: `connector-<service>.json`, `mcp-<source>.json`, `knowledge-<source>`, `notify-<destination>`. Directory mode `0700`, files `0600`. |

## `config.json`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data_dir` | the directory the file is in | Root of the paths below |
| `db_path` | `<data_dir>/yggdrasil.db` | SQLite database |
| `models_dir` | `<data_dir>/models` | Model files |
| `runtimes_dir` | `<data_dir>/runtimes` | Runtime binaries and Python environments |
| `logs_dir` | `<data_dir>/logs` | Log files |
| `web_ui_dir` | empty | A built web UI to serve instead of the bundled one, such as `web/dist` in a clone |
| `web_ui_enabled` | `true` | Serve the web UI at `/` |
| `api_host` | `127.0.0.1` | Address of the API and web UI. Any address other than loopback requires an API key (see [API](api.md#authentication)). |
| `api_port` | `7331` | Port of the API and web UI |
| `lan_api_enabled` | `false` | Set by **Local network access** on the API Access page. Turning it on sets `api_host` to `0.0.0.0` and needs an existing API key. |
| `internal_host` | `127.0.0.1` | Address of Bifrost, the computer-to-computer server. Discovery sets it to `0.0.0.0`. |
| `internal_port` | `7332` | Port of Bifrost |
| `discovery_enabled` | `true` | Advertise and find other computers on the local network over mDNS |
| `static_peers` | none | `host:7332` addresses to try when mDNS cannot see them, such as across Docker networks or a VPN |
| `advertise_host` | the first non-loopback IPv4 address | The address paired computers use to reach this one |
| `node_name` | the host name | The name other computers see |
| `node_id` | generated | This computer's id. Do not copy it between computers. |

Restart the daemon after editing the file by hand. A changed `api_host` or `internal_host` also applies only after a restart, because the daemon keeps the socket it bound at startup.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Overrides | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `YGGDRASIL_API_HOST` | `api_host` | `0.0.0.0` makes the API reachable from other computers. The daemon will not start until a key exists or `YGGDRASIL_API_KEY` is set. |
| `YGGDRASIL_API_PORT` | `api_port` | |
| `YGGDRASIL_API_KEY` | | Stored, hashed, as an API key at startup if it is not already valid. |
| `YGGDRASIL_INTERNAL_HOST` | `internal_host` | |
| `YGGDRASIL_INTERNAL_PORT` | `internal_port` | |
| `YGGDRASIL_DISCOVERY_ENABLED` | `discovery_enabled` | `1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on` turn it on; anything else turns it off. |
| `YGGDRASIL_STATIC_PEERS` | `static_peers` | Comma-separated `host:port` list |
| `YGGDRASIL_ADVERTISE_HOST` | `advertise_host` | |
| `YGGDRASIL_NODE_ID` | `node_id` | For containers with a fixed identity |
| `YGGDRASIL_NODE_NAME` | `node_name` | |
| `YGGDRASIL_WEB_UI_DIR` | `web_ui_dir` | |
| `YGGDRASIL_WEB_UI_ENABLED` | `web_ui_enabled` | |
| `YGGDRASIL_STUB_INFERENCE` | | Answers with a stub model instead of llama.cpp. For tests and the Docker cluster check only. |
| `YGGDRASIL_SANDBOXED` | | `1` behaves as if the daemon ran in the macOS App Sandbox (see [Runtimes](runtimes.md#python-environments-in-sandboxed-builds)). For testing. |

`yggctl` reads two more: `YGGDRASIL_URL` (the daemon address, default `http://127.0.0.1:7331`) and `YGGDRASIL_API_KEY` (sent as the bearer token). See [CLI](cli.md).

## Settings

Settings are stored in `yggdrasil.db`. The app's Settings page shows them, and `GET /api/v1/settings` returns them together with the read-only paths, addresses, and node identity above.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ui_locale` | empty | **App language**, as a BCP 47 tag such as `es` or `pt-BR`. Empty follows each device's system language. The web UI, the desktop app, and the iPhone app read it, so they agree. `en-XA` is the pseudo-locale for testing translations. |
| `advanced_mode` | `false` | Shows Profiles, Tools, and API Access, per-tool permissions, and run details |
| `model_lifecycle` | `automatic` | `automatic` unloads models that sit idle; `manual` leaves them loaded until you stop them |
| `idle_unload_minutes` | `15` | Minutes before an idle model is unloaded; `0` never unloads |
| `keep_running_in_background` | `false` | Keep the daemon running when the desktop window closes. Saving a schedule turns it on. |
| `launch_at_login` | `false` | Start the desktop app at sign-in |
| `default_profile_id` | empty | Profile for new chats |
| `default_execution` | `automatic` | **Run chats on**: `automatic` (Norn picks a computer), `local` (this computer), or `ask` (ask each time) |
| `download_behavior` | `ask` | `ask` before downloading a model, or `automatic` |
| `model_storage_limit_gb` | `0` | Most disk space models may use; `0` is unlimited |
| `save_chat_history` | `true` | Keep chats after they end |
| `save_task_history` | `true` | Keep task history |
| `memory_enabled` | `true` | Persistent memory for chats. Each chat can still turn it off. |
| `notify_task_finish` | `true` | Desktop notices for finished automations and tasks |
| `notify_peer_offline` | `true` | A notice when a paired computer goes offline |
| `notification_quiet_hours` | off, 22:00–07:00 | Quiet hours, as JSON; set them in Settings → Email, push, and webhooks or with `PUT /api/v1/notifications/quiet-hours` |
| `tool_terminal`, `tool_file_writes`, `tool_git` | `ask` | Default policy for the shell, file writes, and Git: `deny`, `ask`, `allow`, or `allow-for-session` |
| `node_name`, `lan_api_enabled`, `discovery_enabled`, `web_ui_enabled` | see `config.json` | Writable through settings; stored in `config.json` |

Personalization (`GET/PUT /api/v1/personalization`) and run-record retention (`GET/PUT /api/v1/privacy`) are stored as settings too. See [API](api.md).

`POST /api/v1/settings/reset` clears application state. With `delete_models=true` it also removes model files. It cannot be undone.

## Daemon flags

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-data-dir <path>` | Use another data directory |
| `-version` | Print the version, license, and corresponding source, then exit |
| `-python-envs` | Print, as JSON, the Python environments a sandboxed app bundles (see [Runtimes](runtimes.md#python-environments-in-sandboxed-builds)), then exit |
